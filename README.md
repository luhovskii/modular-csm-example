# modular-cms-test

This repository contains a small modular PHP CMS used for development and experimentation.

Structure highlights:
- `core/` - framework core files (router, bootstrap, auth, etc.)
- `modules/` - modular features (e.g. `modules/blog`)
- `public/` - webroot and front controller

This README was created by an assistant to initialize a git repository.
